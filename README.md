# odin-recipes

I learned a lot of HTML and CSS when I was in college, however I forgot a lot of it and I want to try pivoting my career into front end deveopment. 

I'm taking The Odin Project's course so I can help myself along this path! 

This is the first project for The Odin Project, which is a recipe website.

I will be practicing basic HTML in this site.
